<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

_This personal project is still in progress_

I've always been curious on what's going on in the different layers of CNNs. That's why I've created a little PyTorch script to see the activation maps of a specific, or all the CNN's layers. 
Moreover, since I'm trying to switch from Tensorflow/Keras to PyTorch, I thought it would be interesting to do this little project to get used to handling torch objects and tensors.

### Built With

* [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/)
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python  â©¾ 3.8
  ```sh
  sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
  ```

### Installation


1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Clement-W/Activation-Maps-Visualiser-PT.git
   cd Activation-Maps-Visualiser-PT/
   ```
